      <h1>Introduction to <notesjs>notes.js</notesjs></h1>
      <p>
        Essentially what this library does is provide an easy way for you to
        display notifications next to a chosen element. For example, one might
        use this to tell the user of a website some information after clicking
        a button. So, let's see what it looks like in a very basic example!
      </p>
      <button
        type="button"
        onclick="Notify(this, 'succ', 'It worked!')">
      Click me!
      </button>
      <p>
        So that's what it looks like. Let's look at the code now.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;button
            type="button"
            onclick="Notify(this, 'succ', 'It worked!')"&gt;

          Click me!

          &lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The most important line here is the one setting the onclick
        attribute of the button, or specifically the call to Notify. Without
        going into too much detail, this constructor simply creates a new
        notification next to a given element. To understand this
        better, let's have a look at the definition of the function itself.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            function Notify(element, type, text, posMode = 1, time = 2500, spacing = 15) {

            ...
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The first parameter - <i>element</i> - is the element next to which you
        want the notification to appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>type</i> is the type of notification.
        This affects its colour, however in the future it'll affect more than this.
        The valid values of this are:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          "succ"  >  Success (green)
          "info"  >  Information (blue)
          "warn"  >  Warning (orange)
          "erro"  >  Error (red)
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Of course, the mentioned colours of each type are only the defaults,
        they can be changed easily - more on that later.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next parameter - <i>text</i> - is quite straightforward. As I'm sure
        you've already guessed, it's the text which <notesjs>notes.js</notesjs>
        puts inside the notification.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last three parameters have default values for convenience, but can
        be changed if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>posMode</i> allows you to choose where the notification is relative
        to the element. We'll look at this in more depth later, but here's some
        of the source code where I write what each mode means.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          ...

          // posModes
          // 1: to the right of the element
          // 2: to the left of the element
          // 3: inside at the left of the element
          // 4: inside at the right of the element

          ...
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        But don't worry if that's too vague, each mode will be looked at more later.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>time</i> is the time (in milliseconds) for which the notification waits
        before beginning to disappear. Note that this is when it <i>begins</i> to
        disappear - it takes a small amount of time to actually fade out.
      </p>
      <p>
        And last but not least: <i>spacing</i> ! This doesn't require that much
        explanation - basically it's how far the notification is away from the
        edge chosen by <i>posMode</i>, of the element, in pixels. It's easier
        to simply think of it as the margin.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Getting started
      </h1>
      <p>
        So, you've decided you want to try <notesjs>notes.js</notesjs> out? Luckily
        for you, it's very very easy to install! Simply download the javascript file,
        <a href="#">minified js</a> or <a href="#">non-minified js</a>, and the
        <a href="#">minified css</a> or <a href="#">non-minified css</a> css file! After
        you've got these, just reference them at the top of your html file, and
        you're ready to go!
        <br>
        It's probably a good idea to download the non-minified css file if you
        plan to modify any of the styles, otherwise it'll be a lot of unrequired
        effort.
        <br>
        It's probably worth testing the library, just to make sure everything's
        working nicely.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          Between the &lt;head&gt; tags

          ...
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/notesjs.css"&gt;
            &lt;script src="path/to/notesjs.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
          ...

          And, between the &lt;body&gt; tags

          ...
            &lt;script&gt;Notify(document.body, 'succ', 'Cool, it worked!', 4, 1000)&lt;/script&gt;
          ...
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        If all's working, this should make a little green notification appear
        at the top right of your page, saying 'Cool, it worked!'. If it didn't,
        have another look through this section and make sure you follow every
        instruction correctly. Oh, also notice how you're changing the time the
        notification stays for to one second.
      </p>
      <h1>posModes</h1>
      <p>
        There are four distinct <i>posMode</i> values.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          1: The outside right of an element. It scales from the left outwards.

          2: The outside left of an element. It scales from the right outwards.

          3: The inside left of an element. It scales from the left inwards.

          4: The inside right of an element. It scales from the right inwards.
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        When I talk about how it scales, I mean to imply where it's origin is.
        Since (using the default css,) the notification begins at a width of 0,
        before it scales to a much wider profile, this is an important piece of
        information - especially when developing this library.
      </p>
      <button type="button" onclick="Notify(this, 'succ', 'Right', 1)">posMode = 1</button>
      <br><br>
      <button type="button" onclick="Notify(this, 'info', 'Left', 2)">posMode = 2</button>
      <br><br>
      <button type="button" onclick="Notify(this, 'warn', 'In left', 3)">posMode = 3</button>
      <br><br>
      <button type="button" onclick="Notify(this, 'erro', 'In right', 4)">posMode = 4</button>
      <p>
        Now obviously, for modes 3 and 4, this wouldn't be the normal use case.
        Usually, the last two modes would be used for things like displaying
        notifications on the document.body element, or inside a large container
        div. Think <i>'your post has been liked!'</i> notifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the first two modes are perfect for things such as
        quick, easy to read dialog boxes, since the chances are they're coming
        up just where your users' eyes are. Think <i>'your post has been sent!'</i>
        notifications.
      </p>
      <h2>Left or right?</h2>
      <p>
        A good guideline generally is to use the right-extending notifications
        for most purposes, but if the element is significantly past the horizontal
        midpoint it seems better to use the left-extending modes. That said, the
        last two modes are a different matter.
        <br>
        In most cases, users will be more inclined to look at the top right of
        their screen than the top left, as far as I know. Perhaps think about
        choosing the mode based on the user's operating system - for Windows
        use mode 4 and for Mac use mode 3 to complement the position of their
        window controls.
      </p>
      <h1>Types</h1>
      <p>
        There are 4 types of notification. Make sure you know the difference
        between <i>posMode</i> and <i>type</i>, because there is a BIG difference.
        <br>
        The <i>type</i> of a notification is essentially what it's trying to tell
        the user - A success, an error, a warning or some information.
      </p>
      <p>
        To choose the type of a notification, simply change the value of the second
        parameter in the constructor. These are your options:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          "succ"  >  Success (green)
          "info"  >  Information (blue)
          "warn"  >  Warning (orange)
          "erro"  >  Error (red)
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Make sure you've got the string value exactly right, otherwise it just
        won't work. Anyway, here's some examples of the different types.
      </p>
      Success: <button type="button" onclick="Notify(this, 'succ', 'Well done!')">Click me!</button>
      <br><br>
      Information: <button type="button" onclick="Notify(this, 'info', '10')">What's 7 + 3</button>
      <br><br>
      Warning: <button type="button" onclick="Notify(this, 'warn', 'Bears!')">What's in the woods?</button>
      <br><br>
      Error: <button type="button" onclick="Notify(this, 'erro', 'I said no to do that!')">Don't click me!</button>
      <p>
        You get the idea.
      </p>
      <h1>But they don't have to be on buttons!</h1>
      <p>
        Of course they don't! I was just using buttons for the purpose of this
        documentation because it makes it a huge amount easier for me. You can put
        them on anything at all - inline elements, inline-blocks, block-level, absolutely
        positioned, fixed positioned, relatively positioned... You name it and you
        can put a notification on it!
      </p>
      <h1>Concerned about memory?</h1>
      <p>
        I've thought a bit about this, and went out of my way to prevent any memory
        leakage. Firstly, the notifications automatically delete themselves after
        they've served their purpose.
        <br>
        Additionally, I've made sure that I don't delete any <i>live</i> HTML
        elements from Javascript incorrectly, since this can cause memory leaks.
        <br>
        <b>But you shouldn't be worried about performance anyway!</b> The code's
        extremely fast - there should be virtually no additional overhead, and
        since it's only about 1.5KB in size, everyone visiting your website will
        be like "Hey, that Javascript library loaded really quickly!"
